# Exact Shell UI Certification Matrix

This tool generates the evidence-routed certification matrix for the active
offline stock-Skirmish shell journey. It is a coverage and provenance artifact,
not a hand-edited parity ledger.

Generate the fail-closed baseline:

```powershell
python -m tools.exact_shell_ui_matrix
python -m tools.exact_shell_ui_matrix --check
python -m tools.exact_shell_ui_matrix.validate target/exact-shell-ui/matrix.v1.json
```

Apply a status/evidence overlay:

```powershell
python -m tools.exact_shell_ui_matrix `
  --evidence target/exact-shell-ui/evidence.v1.json `
  --artifact-root C:/path/to/confined/artifact/root
```

Artifact paths in the evidence manifest are portable paths relative to
`--artifact-root`. Evidence-bearing generation and validation resolve every
artifact beneath that root and hash its actual bytes. Missing files, path
escapes, and digest mismatches fail closed.

`VERIFIED` requires a native-executable differential or exhaustive proof,
resolution coverage where applicable, and resolution of every catalog blocker
attached to the row. Static research and Rust production regressions can be
recorded on `UNVERIFIED` or `DRIFT_FIXED_UNVERIFIED` rows without promoting
them.

The JSON contracts are:

- `matrix.v1.schema.json` — generated self-contained matrix;
- `evidence.v1.schema.json` — optional evidence/status overlay.

Generated artifacts live under `target/exact-shell-ui/`.
