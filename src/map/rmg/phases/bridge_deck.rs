//! Ground checks for a low bridge deck.
//!
//! gamemd: `RandomMapGenerator::PlaceLowBridgeDeck` 0x0058F2C0,
//! `ValidateLowBridgeDeckArea` 0x005902C0 and `PlaceBridgeRepairHut`
//! 0x005904B0, reached from `BridgeAndConnectorPass` 0x0058EF10 for active
//! random-map types 3 and 4.
//!
//! The deck placer tries up to two hundred spots. Each attempt starts by
//! rolling a cell out of [`pick_seed_cell`]. Candidate search is RNG-free; only
//! a committed deck may additionally draw the two conditional end-piece
//! coins. The span goes through [`deck_area_is_clear`] and each end through
//! [`end_area_is_placeable`]. A refusal just moves the placer on.
//!
//! **Those two ground checks look like the same check and are not.** They
//! disagree about the
//! swept extent, the order the reference level is read in, whether overlays
//! matter, and which tiles they will accept — see each one's own note. Sharing
//! a sweep between them would judge the wrong cells in both directions.

///   carries in the disassembly says bridge, and that name is wrong. Porting
///   it from the name would accept cells that already hold a bridge and reject
