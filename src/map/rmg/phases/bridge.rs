//! River-bridge placement for the carved map types.
//!
//! gamemd: `RandomMapGenerator::BuildRiverBridge` 0x0059E740 and
//! `RandomMapGenerator::IsUniformLevelBridgeEndArea` 0x005A7440.
//!
//! The whole random-map generator is dormant in stock YR skirmish:
//! `ScenarioClass::Read_Scenario` 0x00684620 sets `IsRandom` only when the
//! scenario filename's extension matches the string at 0x0083DA88, which is
//! `.SED`, and retail ships `.MPR`/`.YRM`/`.MAP`. Nothing here runs in an
//! ordinary retail match, so this file sits below the divergence cut.
//!
//! When a river's cross-section runs straight for long enough, the walk may
//! throw a bridge across itself: a clearance scan ahead, twelve ranks of water
//! filled in (four near, eight far), the region grown behind the bridge by the
//! meander arm, the shoreline finalized, and the near side dilated. On success
//! the river jumps twelve cells forward and continues on the far bank — under a
//! **new region id**, which is why the finish dilation absorbs the previous id.
//!
//! Everything here is transcribed from the original's four hand-written heading
//! cases. They are *not* rotations of one another and must not be refactored
//! into one parametric form — the N and W deck cases carry level-adjust loops
//! the E and S cases lack.
//!
//! The crossing itself is stamped from the theater's four **waterfall
//! tilesets** — not the bridge sets; the "bridge" naming is inherited drift.
//! Each set holds four pieces: two ends, a two-cell middle and a one-cell
//! middle, alternated by span parity. The stamping consumes no randomness,
//! but it is not cosmetic: its unassigned-tile sentinels and level
//! adjustments are what let the river-finish shore pass accept the junction
//! between the pre-bridge and post-bridge regions.
