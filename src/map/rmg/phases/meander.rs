//! Directional region growth — the "meander arm".
//!
//! Given a region that already exists (a carved river), this grows it outward in
//! a chosen direction: it seeds a priority queue from the region's border, then
//! repeatedly claims the cheapest frontier cell, where cost trades a random term
//! against how far the cell sits off the current heading. The heading itself
//! drifts by a Gaussian every step, so the claimed area wanders rather than
//! running straight — hence the name.
//!
//! Two callers exist in the original. This module serves the canyon: the river's
//! region is grown across the whole map, and the level change that follows is
//! what drops the river into a canyon. The bridge-plateau caller is not ported.
//!
//! **This arm paints nothing.** It writes only the working grid's region id, its
//! per-pass stamp and the water/region flag. Every tile, level and slope change
//! the canyon produces belongs to the caller.
//!
//! ### The enumeration order is not the usual one
//!
//! Almost every per-cell draw in the generator walks cells in the isometric
//! anti-diagonal order that [`RmgGrid::native_cells`] produces. The border
//! collector this arm seeds from does **not**: it sweeps the working grid's
//! records linearly, so it yields cells in row-major order — ascending `y`, then
//! ascending `x`. That difference is invisible everywhere else it is used,
//! because those callers draw no randomness. Here it decides which border cell
//! gets which random draw, so [`region_border_row_major`] exists to reproduce it
//! rather than reusing the lake's collector.
