//! Cutting a cliff stair into the ground.

//! gamemd: `RmgRegion::CarveConnectorsOrBridges` 0x005905D0,
//! `BuildRampOrientationMask` 0x00590FD0, the four straight-ramp carvers
//! `CarveStraightRamp_ClearSouth` 0x005910F0, `_ClearEast` 0x00591740,
//! `_ClearNorth` 0x00591D80, `_ClearWest` 0x00592440, and the two corner
//! carvers `CarveCornerRamp_Diagonal` 0x00593030 and `_Reflected` 0x00593550.
//! Reached by active stock `.SED` generation on random-map types 3 and 4.
//!
//! [`carve_straight_ramp_clear_south`] is the first of the original's seven
//! carve routines. It takes the two endpoints a ramp site chose and turns the
//! ground between them into a walkable stair: two rectangles handed to the
//! lower plateau, two to the upper, a tile block stamped at each end, then the
//! stepped edge itself and the flat run that leads onto it.
//!
//! Two things here are easy to get wrong and expensive to notice:
//!
//! - **The four fill loops split both the region id and the level**, in matched
//!   pairs. Each half of the corridor is handed to the plateau it belongs to.
//!   Tagging the whole corridor with one id compiles, looks right, and hands
//!   half the ramp to the wrong plateau — which only shows up much later, when
//!   starts and tiberium read those ids.
//! - **The end blocks come from a different tileset base than the stepped
//!   edge.** Conflating them stamps plausible-looking wrong tiles.
//!
//! Driven by `carve_driver`, which runs on the two island map types.
