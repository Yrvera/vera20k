//! Deciding where the ramps go: the pass that drives the carve routines.
//!
//! For every pair of adjacent regions that sit at different heights, this rolls
//! how many ramps to cut between them and then hunts along their shared border
//! for places one will fit.
//!
//! Two things are worth knowing before reading it:
//!
//! - **The connection count is not a uniform 1-to-3.** It is 1 whenever the
//!   accessibility roll fails and 2 or 3 when it succeeds, which is a very
//!   different distribution. An accessibility of zero does not switch the pass
//!   off — it makes every pair get exactly one ramp.
//! - **A pair is visited once, from the lower id.** Combined with the ascending
//!   neighbour order this fixes the visit order completely.
//!
//! Water-class regions take the active low-deck branch. That branch owns its
//! own seed rejection draws and conditional end-piece coins; dry regions keep
//! the ramp order described above.
