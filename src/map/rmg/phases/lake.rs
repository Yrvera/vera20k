//! Water seeding for the carved map types (inland and mountainous).
//!
//! These two types are the opposite of the sea-shaping family in `water.rs`:
//! they start from land and *add* water, admitting only clear cells. The seeder
//! makes at most one river system and at most one standalone lake — it is not
//! an iterated fill.
//!
//! This module implements the lake half. The river half, its meander arm and
//! the bridge builder are not modelled yet; the river is gated on a water
//! amount above `RIVER_GATE`, so for `0 < water <= 20` the lake path alone is
//! the whole of the original's output.
//!
//! The lake grows as a priority flood: a random clear seed, a Gaussian target
//! size, then a min-heap walk whose key mixes distance from the seed, a random
//! term and a decay in the number of cells already placed. Growth that touches
//! foreign water fails softly and the whole attempt rolls back.
