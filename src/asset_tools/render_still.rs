//! `asset render` for the two still formats: PCX pictures and PAL palettes.
//!
//! Two renders that share a verb and almost nothing else.
//!
//! A **PCX** is already a finished picture and carries its own trailing VGA
//! table, so there is nothing to infer: [`run_pcx`] leaves
//! `RenderReport::palette` as `None` rather than running the inference chain,
//! because naming a `.pal` there would credit a file that had no part in the
//! colours — and a caller reading the report would have no way to tell the
//! difference. `--palette` is reported as ignored for the same reason.
//!
//! A **PAL** is not a picture at all, so [`run_pal`] draws a diagnostic
//! instrument rather than decoration: 256 labelled swatches in a 16x16 grid,
//! with the house-colour remap band `[16, 32)` outlined and named, because
//! "which indices remap" is the question a palette dump is opened to answer.
//! Index 0 and every entry carrying the raw magenta chroma key are outlined
//! too — both are drawn fully transparent by the standard decode, so their
//! colour alone tells a reader nothing. With `--house` a second grid is drawn
//! with the ramp applied, plus a contact sheet holding both, so the before and
//! after can be compared in one image.
//!
//! Every burned-in label is built from the drawable glyph set only (see
//! [`label_text`]): the shared 5x7 font covers space, `-`, `:`, `/`, digits and
//! letters, and any other character advances the pen while drawing nothing —
//! so an unmapped character in a retail filename would silently vanish from the
//! header instead of looking wrong.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of `asset_tools/`: depends on `assets/` (PCX, palette, archive
//!   resolution), `rules/` (`[Colors]` schemes for `--house`) and the sibling
//!   `canvas` / `identify` / `locate` / `palette` / `report` modules.
//! - Nothing from `sim/`, `render/`, `ui/`, `audio/`, or `net/`.
