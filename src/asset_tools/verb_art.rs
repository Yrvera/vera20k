//! `asset art-for <TYPE>` — from a rules type id to the files that actually back it.
//!
//! "Which SHP does this unit use, and does it exist" is a question that costs a
//! throwaway test every time it is asked, because the answer is three chained
//! conventions: rules `Image=` → art.ini `Image=`/`Cameo=` → a per-theater
//! filename rule that rewrites the second character of the name. Getting one
//! link wrong produces a filename that looks entirely plausible and resolves to
//! nothing.
//!
//! So this verb does not stop at the convention. Every candidate it proposes is
//! looked up, and the report says which archive held it and what the bytes
//! actually are. **The candidate list alone is a guess; the resolution is the
//! answer** — a caller reading only `shp_candidates` has learned nothing it
//! could not have spelled itself.
//!
//! Cameo candidates mirror the production sidebar resolver in
//! `render::sidebar_cameo_atlas` rather than inventing a second convention. Its
//! `.PCX` spelling is deliberately *not* proposed: nothing in this tree resolves
//! a cameo from a PCX, and an unconfirmed convention in the candidate list reads
//! as a documented one.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Depends on `assets/` (archive resolution), `rules/` (the art registry and
//!   its filename-convention helpers), and the sibling `identify` / `locate` /
//!   `report` modules.
//! - Nothing from `sim/`, `render/`, `ui/`, `audio/`, or `net/`. The cameo
//!   ordering is *mirrored* from the render-side resolver, not imported.
