//! Tank-bunker install state machine (building side).
//!
//! Models the `Bunker=yes` mission helper: a facing-driven 6-state machine that,
//! once a candidate unit is on the footprint, shoves blockers, turns the unit to
//! face the building, force-tracks it onto the building cell, turns it South,
//! plays entry anims, then installs (hide + reciprocal link + up sound). The
//! inter-state waits are turn/track completions — NOT frame-count timers.
//!
//! sim/ only — never render/ui/sidebar/audio/net.
