//! Where an entity is drawn: the isometric projection plus every visual-only
//! vertical offset that sits on top of it.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! `Position` used to carry two cached `f32` screen coordinates, and five
//! places in `sim/` wrote them — three of those writing a *visual* height lift
//! that has no simulation meaning. Screen placement is a render concern, so it
//! lives here, and `sim/` no longer writes screen coordinates at all.
//!
//! Nothing is cached. The projection is a handful of multiplies and every
//! input is authoritative sim state, so deriving on read is both cheaper than
//! the invalidation it replaces and immune to the stale-cache class of bug
//! (position mutated by a pass that forgot to refresh).
//!
//! ## The height lift
//!
//! Active YR applies the height lift **once** through `Tactical__AdjustForZ`
//! (`0x006D20E0`) as part of tactical projection:
//!
//! ```text
//! screen_y -= ftol(Z_leptons * k + (Z_leptons >= 728 ? 1 : 0) + 0.5)
//! ```
//!
//! Startup writer `0x006D1BDD` stores `k` with exact f64 bits
//! `0x3FC25E5374344960`; the shared native-x87 substrate owns that value and
//! the 53-bit, truncate-toward-zero operation order.
//!
//! ### What this replaced
//!
//! Until this landed the lift was applied in two layers — the air movement pass
//! wrote `screen_y` with it, and then every app draw path subtracted it again —
//! so airborne units were lifted **twice**, at an effective 0.12 px/lepton,
//! while parachutes and scripted missiles got a single 0.06. Two different
//! scales for one quantity, and neither was gamemd's. At YR's stock
//! `FlightLevel=1500` an aircraft now sits 216px up instead of ~180px, and a
//! paradrop or missile roughly 2.4× higher than before.
//!
//! Frequency: every airborne unit in every match, for as long as it is
//! airborne. Kirovs, Harriers, Rocketeers, Nighthawks, every jumpjet, every
//! paradrop and every missile in flight.
//!
//! ## Two anchors, half a tile apart
//!
//! [`screen_position`] is the entity anchor: the projection of the object's own
//! coordinate, which lands on the centre of the cell's diamond. That is where
//! gamemd draws every class — units, infantry, aircraft, animations,
//! projectiles — and it is half a tile below the row a cell's tile art starts
//! on (`map::terrain::iso_to_screen`).
//!
//! Buildings are the single exception, and [`BUILDING_ART_LIFT_PX`] is that
//! exception's whole content.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of render/ — reads sim/ state read-only and writes none of it.
//! - sim/ NEVER depends on render/, so nothing here may be called from sim/.
