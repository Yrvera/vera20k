//! Retail single-instance startup gate.
//!
//! Native `WinMain` creates a named mutex before it creates a window. When the
//! name is already taken it raises and restores the window the first copy owns,
//! closes its own handle, logs, and returns without ever creating a second
//! window. Two live copies would otherwise both write `RA2MD.INI` on quit —
//! the coherent `[Options]`/`[Video]`/`[Audio]` profile and the `[Skirmish]`
//! snapshot are whole-key overwrites, so the copy that quits second silently
//! discards everything the first one saved.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of util/ — no dependencies on game modules.

/// Native uses a fixed GUID string as both the mutex name and its window class
/// name. VERA deliberately uses its own name: a retail `gamemd.exe` running

/// the native name would make either process treat the other as a second copy
/// of itself. VERA-internal deviation; the native gate's shape is unchanged.

/// own window class, so the title is the available equivalent. Must stay equal

/// VERA-internal substitution; the native lookup key is a class name.
///
